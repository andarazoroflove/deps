These are the dependencies one would need to compile most alt-coins and mainline bitcoin on Windows.

They were compiled with MinGW MSYS on 32bit Windows and should work on just about everything. 

The file "!Building Bitcoin on Windows" is not mine, I simply preserved it here in a direct copy from its original location and it is the document these files were built using.

Clone this repository to C:\ and get building.
